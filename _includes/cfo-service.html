        <li value="13">Appropriate Consultant to the management of the company. Owners of small companies are very familiar with the concept that it is lonely at the top. They frequently don’t have anyone with whom they can discuss strategies and issues. What do you do with that problem customer, supplier, employee, or banker? Which way do you go with that key decision that could determine the future course of your business? Sometimes your CFO support is just a good sounding board. We have a wealth of experience and business insight and a company owner can tap into this.</li>

            <li>Drafting Policies and Procedures to your specific companies’ need.</li>

            <li>Establishing effective internal accounting controls is critical to ensure that your company’s hard earned profits are appropriately accounted for and that no revenue or cost “Leakage” has occurred due to faulty procedures. </li>

            <li>Financial Staff assessment and management: Our clients have one or more people who handle the day to day transactions of the company. We can manage these staff members onsite at a frequency determined by the client’s needs. This allows the business owner to focus on other aspects of the business rather than spending time managing the accounting function. We will identify staff members who are in the wrong job, and we can help find suitable replacements.</li>
